# gleamring
Simple benchmark based on Joe Armstrong's exercise from his book **Programming Erlang: Software for a Concurrent World**.

The exercise is to create N processes linked together in a ring and to send a message that loops the ring M times so that M*N messages are sent in total and to time how long it takes
 

```sh

gleam  run  # Run the project
